# hexnoun!
a [hexcasting](https://modrinth.com/mod/hex-casting) addon made using [allium](https://modrinth.com/mod/allium)

it depends on [hex](https://modrinth.com/mod/hex-casting)/[hexal](https://modrinth.com/mod/hexal)/[moreiotas](https://modrinth.com/mod/moreiotas)/[hexical](https://modrinth.com/mod/hexical/)/[allium](https://modrinth.com/mod/allium) at the moment iirc

it's made for hexjam, i started it just a few hours before the due date at like midnight while never having used this before, so it's very unfinished at the moment

but it does have a pattern to convert between [hexical](https://modrinth.com/mod/hexical/) and [hexal](https://modrinth.com/mod/hexal)([moreiotas](https://modrinth.com/mod/moreiotas)) types, and i was planning on having that pattern convert between a few more types
